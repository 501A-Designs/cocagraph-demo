# cocagraph
A notepad where your notes can connect to each other.
Powered by svelte.

## Saving your data
In cocagraph, each note you take is called a node. Its also to know that cocagraph has no backend. You own your data, which is why cocagraph is built for saving data locally.

1. Cache to your browser (Currently under development)

The easiest way you can save your data at any time is by caching it to your browser. When you create a new node, buttons will show up on the bottom center of the screen for options to cache your data.

2. Saving as a JSON object

Another way you can save your data is by downloading it on your computer as a `.txt` file. The `.txt` file contains a JSON object with every note and connection information saved, so when you open cocagraph on a different computer, you can import the file you saved on a different machine and view your data. Once opened on cocagraphm you can also add new nodes on top of it and download it as a new file.
